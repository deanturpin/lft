## 🚨 ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Non-Fractionable Asset (WEAT)
- Order rejected: `asset "WEAT" is not fractionable`
- **Action**: Issue #39 created, WEAT commented out

### 2. Immediate Re-Entry After Stop Loss
- **UNG Trade 1**: Stopped out at 3:30 PM @ $10.10
- **UNG Trade 2**: Re-entered at 3:31 PM @ $10.06 (1 minute later!)
- **Issue**: No cooldown period preventing immediate re-entry
- **Action**: Issue #19 (cooldowns) should be prioritized

### 3. Missing Account Balance Display
- Cash/buying power not showing in output
- **Issue**: TUI conditional preventing console output
- **Action**: Fix `#ifdef HAVE_FTXUI` logic

### 4. Low Win Rate (32%)
- Below break-even threshold
- Only profitable due to larger wins than losses (payoff ratio 1.18)
- **Risk**: If this continues, profit factor < 1.0 = losing money

---

## 📋 COMPARISON TO BACKTEST

### Backtest Expectations (15-min bars)
- **Total P&L**: $2,782.80 (over 30 days)
- **All strategies enabled**: 5/5
- **Win rates**: 42-45%
- **Average moves**: 12-46 bps

### Today's Reality
- **P&L**: -$15.49 (one day)
- **Win rate**: 32% (lower than backtest)
- **Average moves**: -0.06% (-6 bps avg)

**Verdict**: One day isn't enough to judge. Need weeks of data.

6. **15-Min Bars**: Reduced noise vs 1-min (likely)

---

## ❌ WHAT DIDN'T WORK

1. **Win Rate**: 32% too low (need >40%)
2. **Tech Stocks**: 0% win rate on tech (MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL all lost)
3. **Indices**: QQQ, SPY both losers
4. **No Cooldown**: Immediate UNG re-entry after stop loss
5. **Missing Display**: Can't see account balance during trading

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY ACTIONS

### This Week
1. **#33 - Trade Duration Tracking** 🔥
   - Implement to see actual hold times
   - Validate "one day is enough" assumption

2. **#38 - Session P&L Display** 🔥
   - Show "Started: $98,255, Now: $98,240, P&L: -$15"
   - Fix TUI conditional blocking console output

3. **Monitor for patterns**:
   - Is commodities bias repeating?
   - Is tech underperformance consistent?
   - Is 32% win rate typical or anomaly?

### Next Week
4. **#19 - Cooldowns**
   - Prevent immediate re-entry after stops
   - Consider 15-30 minute cooldown

5. **#39 - Non-fractionable assets**
   - Pre-flight check or static blocklist

### End of Month
6. **#24 - Loss Asymmetry Analysis**
   - After 1 month of data
   - Check if occasional big losses wiping out small wins

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **15-min bars ≠ 15-min holds**
   - Positions still held ~6 hours (to EOD)
   - Signals just generated on 15-min bar closes

2. **Low win rate can still profit**
   - 32% win rate but payoff ratio 1.18 kept losses small
   - Need to maintain larger wins than losses

3. **Asset class matters**
   - Commodities +$26.82
   - Tech -$19.21
   - Clear divergence today

4. **One day proves nothing**
   - -$15 is essentially breakeven (-0.02%)
   - Need weeks of data to validate strategy

5. **System infrastructure solid**
   - No technical failures
   - All planned features working
   - Ready for scale

## 📊 NEXT SESSION GOALS

**Tomorrow (Jan 16):**
- [ ] Monitor if commodity bias continues
- [ ] Watch for tech stock recovery
- [ ] Track win rate (target >35%)
- [ ] Implement session P&L display (#38)

**This Week:**
- [ ] Implement trade duration tracking (#33)
- [ ] Run 5-day backtest comparison
- [ ] Analyze if 15-min bars better than 1-min baseline

**End of Month:**
- [ ] 20-day performance review
- [ ] Strategy-level analysis
- [ ] Decision: Keep 15-min bars or adjust?

---

## 💭 FINAL THOUGHTS

**The Good:**
- Survived first day with new strategy
- Small loss well within acceptable range
- System infrastructure working perfectly
- Good data collected for analysis

**The Concerning:**
- Win rate below expectations (32% vs 42%)
- Tech stocks all losers
- Indices underperformed

**The Verdict:**
**Too early to judge.** One day of data isn't statistically significant. The -$15 loss is essentially noise. Need at least 20 trading days to evaluate if 15-minute bars are an improvement.

**Recommendation:** Continue with 15-min bars, implement tracking tools (#33, #38), and re-evaluate end of January.
